== Introduction ==

eHAL stands for Embedded Hardware Abstraction Layer, the goal of the project
is to create a single simple to use hardware interfaces to the various
architectures and MCUs available in the market.

With a common API, it will be possible create a driver only once and reuse it
in any of the supported hardware by the eHAL reducing greatly the amount of
time developing these secondary software and focusing on the final application.

The drivers based on eHAL will be developed in another repository, this one
will have strictly the internal hardware abstraction.

== Roadmap ==

- PORT
- PIN
- UART
- SLEEP
- CPU (Global Interruption control & low level functions for task switching)
- SPI
- I2C/TWI
- integration with Mutex and read/write locks
- add examples and tutorials
- DMA
- RTC
